# ApiClient.Launch method

In order to automate execution, games should be set to automatically start at the desired screen resolution and require no additional external dialogs to start. These can typically be set in Unity under Build Settings &gt; Resolution, Other Settings, etc...

```csharp
public static int Launch(string filename, string arguments = "")
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| filename | The path to the executable. In Windows, this should follow the standard “C:\folder\subfolder\filename.exe” convention. |
| arguments | Command line arguments to pass to the executable. |

## Return Value
