# ApiClient.TouchInput method (1 of 2)

Send a raw TouchInput event to the game.

```csharp
public bool TouchInput(Vector2 startPosition, Vector2 destinationPosition, int fingerId, 
    int tapCount = 1, ulong frameCount = 5, bool waitForEmptyInput = true, float radius = 20, 
    float pressure = 1, float altitudeAngle = 0, float azmulthAngle = 0, 
    float maximumPossiblePressure = 1, int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| startPosition | Vector position of the start of the touch input. |
| destinationPosition | Vector destination position of where the touch input ends. |
| fingerId | The finder id of the touch input. |
| tapCount | The number of taps that should be registered. |
| frameCount | The number of frames to complete the tap input over. |
| waitForEmptyInput | If TRUE, wait for the Empty Input event to be broadcast before returning from the method. |
| radius | The radius of the touch input. |
| pressure | The pressure of the touch input. |
| altitudeAngle | The altitude angle of the touch input. |
| azmulthAngle | The azimuth angle of the touch input. |
| maximumPossiblePressure | The maximum possible pressure for the touch input. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the GameDriver agent was able to process the request successfully.

## Examples

```csharp
// Performs a single touch input from 0,0 to 100, 100 with a single "finger" over a duration of 50 frames
api.TouchInput(new Vector2(0, 0), new Vector2(100, 100), 0, 1, 50);
```

| tapCount | The number of taps that should be registered. |
| frameCount | The number of frames to complete the tap input over. |
| waitForEmptyInput | If TRUE, wait for the Empty Input event to be broadcast before returning from the method. |
| radius | The radius of the touch input. |
| pressure | The pressure of the touch input. |
| altitudeAngle | The altitude angle of the touch input. |
| azmulthAngle | The azmulth ange of the touch input. |
| maximumPossiblePressure | The maximum possible pressure for the touch input. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the GameDriver agent was able to process the request successfully.

## Examples

```csharp
// Performs a single touch input from 0,0 to 100, 100 with a single "finger" over a duration of 50 frames
