# ApiClient.EnableObjectCaching method

Enable the use of object caching when performing HierarchyPath object resolution. Object caching is per HierarchyPath stored in a [System.Collections.IDictionary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.idictionary). If a matching HierarchyPath is already in the dictionary, then the stored object is returned. The only way to update a cached reference is for the reference to be garbage collected or flush the cache with [`FlushObjectLookupCache`](./FlushObjectLookupCache.md).

```csharp
public bool EnableObjectCaching(int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the GameDriver agent successfully processed the request.

## Examples

```csharp
api.EnableObjectCaching();
```
