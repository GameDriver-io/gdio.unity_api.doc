# ApiClient.PoseInputEvent method

Use this function to send arbitrary combinations of Vector3 and Quaternions to a game. This is usually the way when dealing with matrices. This is only used by SteamVR for now.

```csharp
public bool PoseInputEvent(string inputControlPath, Vector3 valueV, Quaternion valueQ, 
    ulong numberOfFrames, int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| inputControlPath | The Input Control Path for the New Input System |
| valueV | Value of the Vector3 value of the event |
| valueQ | Value of the Quaternion value of the event |
| numberOfFrames | The number of frames to press and hold the axis for. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the GameDriver agent successfully processed the request.

## Examples

```csharp
api.PoseInputEvent("actions/default/in/Pose", new Vector3(0, 0, 5), api.EulerToQuat(0.0f, 90.0f, 0.0f), 2); // Set a SteamVR action position and rotation.
```
