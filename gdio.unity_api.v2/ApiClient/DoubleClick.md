# ApiClient.DoubleClick method (1 of 2)

Use this function to perform in-game mouse double-clicks.

```csharp
public bool DoubleClick(MouseButtons buttonId, Vector2 position, ulong clickFrameCount, 
    int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buttonId | The mouse button to use for the double click operation. See MouseButtons. |
| position | The Vector2 location to double click in Screen space. |
| clickFrameCount | The number of frames to double click the specific position. |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response that the Click request was processed. Input requests process asynchronously, so a response does NOT imply the input operation has completed. |

## Examples

```csharp
//Double-clicks the left mouse button at position 0, 0 on the screen over a duration of 30 frames.
            api.DoubleClick(MouseButtons.LEFT, new Vector2(0, 0), 30, 30);
```
