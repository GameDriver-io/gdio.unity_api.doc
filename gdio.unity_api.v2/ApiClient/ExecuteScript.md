# ApiClient.ExecuteScript&lt;T&gt; method (2 of 2)

This method executes a Lua script and returns the value of type T. Since a return value is expected, this script can only be executed once.

```csharp
public T ExecuteScript<T>(string script, int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The Type of the field or property to be inspected. |
| script | The Lua script to be executed |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

Returns an object of type T for the value or throws an Exception on error.

## Examples

// Searches for an object named 'HiddenCube' which is invisible in the scene, and checks whether the "Active" checkbox is enabled.

```csharp
bool invisCube = api.GetObjectFieldValue<bool>("//*[@name='HiddenCube']/fn:component('UnityEngine.Behaviour')/@isActiveAndEnabled");
Assert.IsTrue(invisCube == false, "The invisible cube isn't active"); //Passes if the object is Active in the scene
```
