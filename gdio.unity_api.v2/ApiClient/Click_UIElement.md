# ApiClient.Click_UIElement method

Use this function to perform in-game mouse-clicks with the UIToolkit.

```csharp
public bool Click_UIElement(MouseButtons buttonId, float x, float y, ulong clickFrameCount, 
    KeyCode[] modifiers, int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buttonId | The mouse button to use for the click operation. See MouseButtons. |
| x | The X coordinate of the game to click in Screen space. |
| y | The Y coordinate of the game to click in Screen space. |
| clickFrameCount | The number of frames to click the specific position. |
| modifiers | The modifiers to be applied when clicking. |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response that the Click request was processed. Input requests process asynchronously, so a response does NOT imply the input operation has completed. |

## Examples

```csharp
api.ClickUIToolkit(MouseButtons.LEFT, 0, 0, 30, new Keycode[] { Keycode.LeftShift } 30); //Clicks the left mouse button at 0,0 for 30 frames with Shift modifier pressed
```
