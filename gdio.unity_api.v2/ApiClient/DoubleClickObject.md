# ApiClient.DoubleClickObject method

Use this function to interact with an object in game using a mouse double-click.

```csharp
public bool DoubleClickObject(MouseButtons buttonId, string hierarchyPath, ulong frameCount, 
    string cameraHierarchyPath = "", int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buttonId | The mouse button to use for the double click operation. See MouseButtons. |
| hierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath for the GameObject to perform a double click on. |
| frameCount | The number of frames to double-click the specific object. |
| cameraHierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath to the Camera rendering the object. An empty string uses Camera.main |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response that the DoubleClickObject request was processed. Input requests process asynchronously, so a response does NOT imply the input operation has completed. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the GameDriver agent successfully processed the request.

## Examples

```csharp
//Locates and double-clicks the first object with the name "Cube" over a period of 30 frames using the left mouse button.
            api.DoubleClickObject(MouseButtons.LEFT,
                "//*[@name='Cube']", 30, "", 30); // Using the default camera to locate the object.
            api.DoubleClickObject(MouseButtons.LEFT,
                "//*[@name='Cube']", 30, "//*[@name='AlternateCamera']/fn:component('UnityEngine.Camera')", 30); // Using AlternateCamera to locate the object.
```
