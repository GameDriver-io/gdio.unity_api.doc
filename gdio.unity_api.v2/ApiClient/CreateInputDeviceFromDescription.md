# ApiClient.CreateInputDeviceFromDescription method

Use this function to create a device from a controller's description file. Use "LoadDeviceDescription" to obtain the jsonDescription string, or create your own.

```csharp
public string CreateInputDeviceFromDescription(string jsonDescription, string deviceName, 
    string[] deviceTags = null, bool appendName = false, string baseLayoutName = null, 
    int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| jsonDescription | The Json controller description loaded into a string |
| deviceName | The custom name for the device. Duplicated names will only return the already existing device. |
| deviceTags | Tags attached to this device, used in finding a path to it. Tags "Gamepad" should be added for gamepads and "LeftHand" or "RightHand" for VR controllers |
| appendName | Whether the name will have GDIO appended to it at the beginning. Note that if using the recorder, this should be false. |
| baseLayoutName | The name of the base this layout is based on. This is a fallback in case the controller is not supported. Use "Gamepad", "OculusHMD", "OculusController", "XRHMD", "XRController" or "TrackedDevice" depending on the device In Unity, other layout names from the layout list can be tested if you know more about them |
| timeout | The amount of time in seconds to wait for connectivity to establish with the game. |
