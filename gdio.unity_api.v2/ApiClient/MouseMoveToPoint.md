public bool MouseMoveToPoint(Vector2 destination, ulong frameCount, Vector2 origin = null,

```

| frameCount | The number of frames to complete the operaiton over. |

```csharp
// First get the position of an object named "Cube" on screen
Vector3 cubePos = api.GetObjectPosition("//*[@name='Cube']", CoordinateConversion.WorldToScreenPoint);

// Take the x,y values of the on-screen object
Vector2 cubePos2 = new Vector2(cubePos.x, cubePos.y);

//Move the mouse to the cube on-screen position over 30 frames
api.MoveMouseToPoint(cubePos2, (ulong) api.GetLastFPS());
