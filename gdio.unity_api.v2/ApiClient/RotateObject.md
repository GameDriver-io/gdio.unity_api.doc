# ApiClient.RotateObject method (1 of 4)

Rotate an object defined by the HierarchyPath and rotated by a Quaternion. [https://scriptinghelpers.org/blog/how-to-think-about-quaternions](https://scriptinghelpers.org/blog/how-to-think-about-quaternions) for more information.

```csharp
public bool RotateObject(string hierarchyPath, Quaternion quaternion, bool waitForObject = true, 
    int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| hierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath for the object to rotate. |
| quaternion | The quaternion value to manipulate the object. |
| waitForObject | Wait for the object to exist if it doesn't. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the method call was successfully processed by the GameDriver agent.

## Examples

```csharp
api.RotateObject("//*[@name='Cylinder']", new Quaternion(0, 0, 2, 2), true);
```

# ApiClient.RotateObject method (2 of 4)

Rotate an object defined by the HierarchyPath and rotated by Eulers. [https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Rotate.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Rotate.html) for more information.

```csharp
public bool RotateObject(string hierarchyPath, Vector3 eulers, Space relativeTo = Space.Self, 
    bool waitForObject = true, int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| hierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath for the object to rotate. |
| eulers | The Eulers vector to manipulate the object. |
| relativeTo | The Space to perform the rotation relative to. |
| waitForObject | Wait for the object to exist if it doesn't. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the method call was successfully processed by the GameDriver agent.

## Examples

```csharp
//Rotates an object with the name "Cylinder" by 30 degrees on the y axis.
            api.RotateObject("//*[@name='Cylinder']", new Vector3(0, 30, 0), Space.Self, true);
```

# ApiClient.RotateObject method (3 of 4)

Rotate an object defined by the HierarchyPath and rotated by the axis and angle, relative to the Space

```csharp
public bool RotateObject(string hierarchyPath, Vector3 axis, float angle, 
    Space relativeTo = Space.Self, bool waitForObject = true, int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| hierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath for the object to rotate. |
| axis |  |
| angle |  |
| relativeTo | The Space to perform the rotation relative to. |
| waitForObject | Wait for the object to exist if it doesn't. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the method call was successfully processed by the GameDriver agent.

## Examples

```csharp
//Will rotate an object named "Cylinder" on all 3 axis by 45-degrees
            api.RotateObject("//*[@name='Cylinder']", new Vector3(0, 0, 0), 45);
```

# ApiClient.RotateObject method (4 of 4)

Rotate an object defined by the HierarchyPath and rotated by the x, y, and z angles relative to the Space

```csharp
public bool RotateObject(string hierarchyPath, float xAngle, float yAngle, float zAngle, 
    Space relativeTo = Space.Self, bool waitForObject = true, int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| hierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath for the object to rotate. |
| xAngle | The X angle value to rotate. |
| yAngle | The Y angle value to rotate. |
| zAngle | The Z angle value to rotate. |
| relativeTo | The Space to perform the rotation relative to. |
| waitForObject | Wait for the object to exist if it doesn't. |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the method call was successfully processed by the GameDriver agent.

## Examples

```csharp
//Rotates an object with the name "Cylinder" by 20 degrees on the z axis
            api.RotateObject("//*[@name='Cylinder']", 0, 0, 20);
```
