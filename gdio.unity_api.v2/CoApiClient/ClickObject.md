# CoApiClient.ClickObject method

Use this function to interact with an in-game object using mouse-clicks.

```csharp
public IEnumerator<bool> ClickObject(MouseButtons buttonId, string hierarchyPath, ulong frameCount, 
    int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buttonId | The mouse button to use for the click operation. See MouseButtons. |
| hierarchyPath | The HierarchyPath for the GameObject to perform a click on. |
| frameCount | The number of frames to click the specific object. |
| timeout | The number of frames to hold the keys down before clicking. Total press frame count is keyFrames + frames. Input requests process asynchronously, so a response does NOT imply the input operation has completed. |

## Examples

```csharp
//Locates and clicks the first object with the name "Cube" for 30 frames using the left mouse button.
            api.ClickObject(MouseButtons.LEFT,
                "//*[@name='Cube']", 30, 30);
```
