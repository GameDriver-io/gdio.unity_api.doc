Wait for a collision event to fire on an element that is being monitored for collisions. If the method has been called before, there is the potential that another event was recieved before waiting on the event again.

```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| eventId | The eventId received from the [`RegisterCollisionMonitor`](./RegisterCollisionMonitor.md) call. |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a collision event to be fired. |

api.WaitForCollisionEvent{object}(eventId);
```
