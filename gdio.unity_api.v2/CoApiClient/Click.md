    int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buttonId | The mouse button to use for the click operation. See MouseButtons. |
| position | The Vector2 position to perform the mouse click. |
| clickFrameCount | The number of frames to click the specific position. |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response that the Click request was processed. Input requests process asynchronously, so a response does NOT imply the input operation has completed. |

```
