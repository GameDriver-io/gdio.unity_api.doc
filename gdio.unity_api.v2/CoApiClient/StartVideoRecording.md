# CoApiClient.StartVideoRecording method (1 of 3)

Use this function to start a video recording of the game's screen.

```csharp
public IEnumerator<bool> StartVideoRecording(float imageScale = 1, int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| imageScale | The factor to multiply the current screen resolution by to get the resolution for the output video |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response |

## Examples

```csharp
// Record a video with half the resolution of the screen
api.StartVideoRecording(0.5f);
api.Wait(3000);
// Save the video local to the test with the name "output.avi" and overwrite if it already exists
api.StopVideoRecording("output", false, FileCollisionOption.UseExisting);
```

# CoApiClient.StartVideoRecording method (2 of 3)

Start a video recording of the game's screen. Using the screen position of a specific game object capture around.

```csharp
public IEnumerator<bool> StartVideoRecording(string trackObjectFromPath, float imageScale = 1, 
    float magnification = 1, int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| trackObjectFromPath | The hierarchy path of a game object for the capture to be centered on |
| imageScale | The factor to multiply the current screen resolution by to get the resolution for the output video |
| magnification | The factor to scale the captured texture by. 2.0f == 2x magnification. Treats the position of the object provided by *trackObjectFromPath* as the point magnify towards |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response |

## Examples

```csharp
// Record a video with half the resolution of the screen
api.StartVideoRecording(0.5f);
api.Wait(3000);
// Save the video local to the test with the name "output.avi" and overwrite if it already exists
api.StopVideoRecording("output", false, FileCollisionOption.UseExisting);

# CoApiClient.StartVideoRecording method (3 of 3)

Start a video recording of the game's screen. Using a specific screen position to center the capture around.

```csharp
public IEnumerator<bool> StartVideoRecording(Vector2 centerOnPosition, float imageScale = 1, 
    float magnification = 1, int timeout = 60)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| centerOnPosition | The screen-position to center the video capture on |
| imageScale | The factor to multiply the current screen resolution by to get the resolution for the output video |
| magnification | The factor to scale the captured texture by. 2.0f == 2x magnification. Treats the value of *centerOnPosition* as the point magnify towards |
| timeout | The number of seconds to wait for a response |

## Examples

```csharp
// Record a video with half the resolution of the screen
api.StartVideoRecording(0.5f);
api.Wait(3000);
// Save the video local to the test with the name "output.avi" and overwrite if it already exists
api.StopVideoRecording("output", false, FileCollisionOption.UseExisting);
```
